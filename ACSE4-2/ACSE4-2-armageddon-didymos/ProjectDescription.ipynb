    "## Synopsis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. The fate of an asteroid is a complex function of its initial mass, speed, trajectory angle and internal strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid) 10-100 m in diameter can penetrate deep into Earth’s atmosphere and disrupt catastrophically, generating an atmospheric disturbance ([airburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst)) that can cause [damage on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo). Such an event occurred over the city of [Chelyabinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor) in Russia, in 2013, releasing energy equivalent to about 520 [kilotons of TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) (1 kt TNT is equivalent to $4.184 \\times 10^{12}$ J), and injuring thousands of people ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642); [Brown et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12741)). An even larger event occurred over [Tunguska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event), an unpopulated area in Siberia, in 1908. \n",

    "### Asteroid break-up and spreading\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to assume (for simplicity) that, prior to break-up, the radius (and cross-sectional area) of the asteroid remains constant; that is, any mass-loss by **ablation** does not change the cross-sectional area of the asteroid. We will further assume a spherical asteroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used criterion for the break-up of an asteroid in the atmosphere is when the ram pressure of the air interacting with the asteroid $\\rho_a v^2$ first exceeds the strength of the asteroid $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_a v^2 = Y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Should break-up occur, the asteroid deforms and spreads laterally as it continues its passage through the atmosphere. As a result its radius and cross-sectional area increase, but the asteroid density is assumed to remain constant (often referred to as 'pancaking'). It is conventional to define the cross-sectional area of the expanding asteroid as $A = \\pi r^2$ (i.e., assuming a circular cross-section), for use in the above equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several models for the radial spreading rate $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ have been proposed. In the simplest model, the fragmented asteroid’s spreading rate is related to its along trajectory speed [(Hills and Goda, 1993)](http://doi.org/10.1086/116499):\n",

    "### A typical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a typical solution to the above set of equations for an impact airburst scenario. The kinetic energy loss per unit height, which is a good approximation for the energy transferred to the atmosphere as heat (and is often referred to as the energy deposited per km altitude), is shown as a function of altitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/airburst.png\" width=\"640\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario the asteroid experiences breakup at approximately 48-km altitude (denoted by the star), before spreading and decelerating rapidly until an altitude of approximately 15 km at which point the **energy loss per unit height** is **maximum**. This point is often considered to be the **burst altitude**. The total kinetic energy lost by the asteroid at this point is a good estimate of the airburst energy (i.e., the total energy deposited into the atmosphere) for hazard analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude well (>5 km) above the surface can be considered to be **airburst events** and are unlikely to form a sizable crater on the ground. In such cases, even if a substantial fraction of the original asteroid survives to the ground it will be decelerated to a very small fraction of its initial speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude below the surface (i.e., peak energy deposition per unit height is not reached before the asteroid strikes the ground) will form a sizable impact crater on the ground and can be considered as a **cratering event** (although a sizable proportion of the original kinetic energy of the asteroid may be transferred to the air).\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these scenarios is a complex regime where a **low altitude airburst combined with a substantial crater-forming event** is likely. This regime is not well understood.\n"

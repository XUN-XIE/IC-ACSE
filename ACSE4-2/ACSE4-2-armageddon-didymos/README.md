# ACSE-4-armageddon

Asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. The fate of an asteroid is a complex function of its initial mass, speed, trajectory angle and internal strength. 

[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid) 10-100 m in diameter can penetrate deep into Earth’s atmosphere and disrupt catastrophically, generating an atmospheric disturbance ([airburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst)) that can cause [damage on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo). Such an event occurred over the city of [Chelyabinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor) in Russia, in 2013, releasing energy equivalent to about 520 [kilotons of TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) (1 kt TNT is equivalent to 4.184e12 J), and injuring thousands of people ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642); [Brown et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12741)). An even larger event occurred over [Tunguska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event), an unpopulated area in Siberia, in 1908. 

This tool predicts the fate of asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere for the purposes of hazard assessment.

### Installation Guide

To install the Asteroid Impact Simulator, the user must run, in the command line, either: 

`python setup.py install`

or 

`python setup.py install --user`

### User instructions

To interact with the Asteroid module, in the command line use:

`python asteroid.py`

This command has the following optional arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| :-------: | ----------- |
| `-h or` <br/><br/> `--help`| Lists the optional arguments. |
| `-p or` <br/><br/> `--planet` | Append `'Earth"`, `"Mars"` or `"Custom"` to specify which planet the asteroid will be impacting. |
| `-r or` <br/><br/> `--rho_atmos` | Append `"exponential"`, `"mars"`, `"tabular"` or `"constant"` to choose the atmospheric density model used in the simulation. |
| `-e or` <br/><br/> `--event` | Append `"Impact"` to simulate an asteroid's trajectory towards a Planet. <br> This will prompt the user to enter the following initial parameters: <br> Radius, Velocity, Density, Strenth, Angle and Altitude. <br> Pressing enter thorugh these prompts will run the simulation with the module's default parameters. <br> Prints a dictionary containing the key results and the outcome of the asteroid event. <br/><br/>Append `"Ensemble"` to generate a statistical ensemble of the probability distributions of each parameter. The default number of samples is 20. <br/><br/>Append `"Reverse"` to determine the asteroid size & strength for a given kinetic energy loss per unit height vs. altitude curve. <br>The default finds the optimal asteroid size & strength for a dataset from the Chelyabinsk event. |
| `-s or` <br/><br/> `--sample` | To be appended after `-e Impact`. Runs an example scenario of either an                                         "Airbust" event, a "Cratering" event or an "Airbust and Cratering" event. |
| `-n or` <br/><br/> `--num` | To be appended after `-e Ensemble`. Allows the user to specify the number of                                    samples for the statistical ensemble. |
| `--silent` | Append to not plot any results for the impact simulation. |

Example:

If the user wanted to run the example simulation of an Airburst and Cratering event on Earth with a tabular atmospheric density model and with no ploting, the following command line would be used:

`python asteroid.py -p Earth -r Tabular -e Impact -s "Airburst and Cratering" --silent`



### Documentation

The code includes [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation. On systems with Sphinx installed, this can be built by running

```
python -m sphinx docs html
```

then viewing the `index.html` file in the `html` directory in your browser.

For systems with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed, a manual pdf can be generated by running

```
python -m sphinx  -b latex docs latex
```

Then following the instructions to process the `Armageddon.tex` file in the `latex` directory in your browser.

### Testing

The tool includes several tests, which you can use to check its operation on your system. With [pytest](https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest) installed, these can be run with

```
python -m pytest armageddon
```

#### Notes

* The analytical solution equation:

v=v_0e^{-\frac{C_D\rho_oAH}{2msin\theta}e^{-\frac{z}{H}}}

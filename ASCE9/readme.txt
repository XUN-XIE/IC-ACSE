The code presented is one of the examples of the case studies performed in the work. 
For this particular code the GPhour sampling strategy is used.  
A general code can be availed from the authors on request.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Before running the code, first UTide matlab files must be downloaded from online sources and placed in the UTide folder. 

There are three UTide files that must be placed in the UTide folder:
1) ut_solv.m
2) ut_reconstr.m
3) ut_constants.mat

The UTide code makes the harmonic analysis computations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To execute the code, run the run_code.m file in the main folder. 
The file prediction.m is used for computing the predictions, making plots and determing the mean squared error.

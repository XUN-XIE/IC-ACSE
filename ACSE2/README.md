On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

1.	Describe the mathematics underpinning continuum mechanics.
2.	Derive the fundamental governing equations of continuum mechanics.
3.	Relate the continuum descriptions of deformation and stress to the fundamental governing equations of continuum mechanics.
4.	Consider the application of appropriate governing equations of continuum mechanics.

qood question - you won't be asked to do very long mathematical proofs, but say based on today's lecture I could ask something like "For a function F(x): R -> R^n, write down the first two terms of the Taylor series approximation for a point x1 near x0. Derive an equation that solves for which x1, the sum of these first two terms is zero. Discuss how your result relates to Newton's method." I might give you a quadratic equation and ask you to derive the linear equation that gives its minimum. I'm not going to ask you to derive Conjugate Gradient from scratch, or the Trust Region method etc. There will also be some calculations, but they will have to be simple, as your time is limited. There will also be questions where you will be asked to reason about why a solving strategy hasn't worked. So I could be describing some realistic situation where I give you some output from which you should be able to diagnose what went wrong. For instance I might give you the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the function I was trying to minimize, you see that there is a negative and a positive eigenvalue, and you draw a conclusion as to why the opimisation strategy I have used did not work, and maybe you can suggest a better alternative.
We will prepare some sample exam questions (covering all 12 lectures) that should hopefully give you a better idea

## Learning outcomes:

On successfully completion of this module, students will be able to:

1.	Critique the purpose, opportunities and limitations of inversion and optimisation in practical science and engineering problems.
2.	Formulate appropriate inverse and optimisation problems in order to solve physical problems.
3.	Explain and solve, mathematically and computationally, linear, non-linear and linearised problems.
4.	Describe, implement and use: least-squares solutions, minimum-norm solutions, generalised inverse solutions, gradient descent methods, conjugate gradients, second-order methods, model regularisation, constraints and penalties, and the adjoint method to calculate gradients.
5.	Find local solutions to non-linear problems.
6.	Find global solutions to non-linear problems. 

## Reading list:
The course material will be covered in Jupyter notebooks for each lecture. Pointers for further

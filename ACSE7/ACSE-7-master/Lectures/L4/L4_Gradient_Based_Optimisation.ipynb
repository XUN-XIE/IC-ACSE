    "We will continue on the subject of quasi Newton methods, by discussing multi-dimensional secant methods, which build up an approximation of the Hessian by looking at the difference in subsequently computed first derivatives. A very popular method in optimisation is BFGS, which guarantees that the approximated Hessian is SPD. The limited memory version L-BFGS limits memory use (and computational time) by throwing away some older information, and in some cases actually improves the Hessian approximation when the local Hessian has changed from the initial location. An issue with secant methods is that the scaling of the initial Hessian influences the convergence.\n",
    "Further in this lecture, we discuss different criteria to decide when to stop the iteration for the various iterative methods that are discussed in this course. This brings us to the concept of truncated Newton methods, which rather than solving the linear system associated with the Newton step exactly, uses an iterative method with a very loose tolerance. This not only saves on computation but remarkably also improves the robustness of the method. Finally, we discuss how to obtain and test the gradient information that is required in Newton and quasi Newton methods.\n",

The absolute function error $\\| \\vec F(\\vec x^{(i)}) \\|$ then measures the square of the error in the distance to the objects. Suppose we're choosing to use SI units, and express coordinates and distances in metres. If the objects in our problem are planets, and we find an error of a kilometre acceptable then we should allow for an absoluter error in $\\vec F$ of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}}=10^6$. If on the other hand, our objects are molecules, and an acceptable error in the position is $\\approx 1$nm, then we should set $\\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}}=10^{-18}$.\n",

    "Of course a better choice of units would lead to a much better scaling of this problem. For more complex problems, *nondimensionalisation* may achieve the same, but this relies on good estimates of typical values for variables and terms in your equations. In particular, in complex, nonlinear problems the typical values of $\\vec F$ may vary a lot throughout the domain, and it can be hard to predict what a small enough value of $\\|\\vec F\\|$ is for a reasonably good approximation of $\\vec x^*$. In practice tolerances are therefore often chosen to be very strict (e.g. orders of magnitude smaller than a 'back-of-the-envelope' estimate). Only once the error is better-understood after a number of solves, we can then try to loosen the tolerance to see if we can improve efficiency without deteriorating the result."

    "In some situations we may know that our initial guess $\\vec x^{(0)}$ is already a fairly good approximation of $\\vec x^*$. A good example is that of a time-stepping numerical model, where the solution from the previous time-step is a good initial guess for the solution at the next time step (assuming our time-step is small enough). In such situations, a lot of these scaling issues with a stopping criterion based on the absolute error can be avoided by using the stopping criterion:\n",

Again, it is advisable to start with a strict criterion. In the time-stepping numerical model for instance, we would only start loosening the tolerance once it's established that the model is running stably, so that we can investigate whether we can make the model more efficient with a larger value of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{rel}}$ without making the model unstable.\n",

    "\n",
    "then we may terminate the iteration. These type of stopping criteria are called <a class=\"definition\" href=\"#definitions\" id=\"stallingcriteria\">stalling criteria</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several pitfalls with this approach. A stalling criterion  based on changes in $\\vec F$ may lead to early termination when moving through parts of the domain where $\\vec F$, is relatively flat. In contrast, in parts of the domain where $\\vec F$ is steep, i.e. a small change in $\\vec x$ leads to a large change in $\\vec F$, we may decide to terminate\n",
    "based on a stalling criterion in $\\vec x$, while we could easily reduce $\\vec F$ further.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general problem with stalling criteria is that they rely on a guarantee that the method actually converges to the desired answer $\\vec x^*$ if we let it continue (i.e. iterate) for long enough. Although we have encountered some methods that have guaranteed convergence properties, for many methods there are no such guarantees. Even methods that do have guarantees, these only apply under certain strict conditions. For instance we have seen that for linear inversion problems the Conjugate Gradient method is guaranteed to converge in $n$ iterations, but only if the linear system matrix $\\mat A$ is SPD. In practice, it is very hard to check these conditions. In particular differentiability, often a condition for nonlinear methods, is frequently violated in practice. Furthermore there are all sorts of other subtle issues, like for instance machine round-off errors, that mean that the theoretical convergence does not happen in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the method does not converge to $\\vec x^*$, there are two possibilities: 1) $\\vec x^{(i)}$ does not converge at all - in this case the method will never terminate, 2) $\\vec x^{(i)}$ does converge, but to the wrong answer; in this case the stalling criterion will terminate the iteration, but we have no indication of whether the answer is any good or not. On the other hand, if we use a criterion based on the residual (absolute or relative), the method will not terminate in either case. There we can simply apply a maximum number of iterations, and return an error if the maximum is exceeded. If the method is terminated before-hand, we at least have some confidence in the quality of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these objections, stalling criteria are still often used in practice. One reason for this is that the stalling criterion based on $\\varepsilon_{\\vec x, \\text{stall}}$ only relies on the scaling of $\\vec x$, which is often easier to control than the scaling of the residual $\\vec F$. Given the arguments above however, a termination based on this criterion should always be followed by a check for the quality of the result, for instance by checking the residual for the final iteration."

    "## Stopping Criteria for Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "For an optimisation problem, the best criterion to determine whether we are close to a local minimum, or at least a stationary point, is to look at the magnitude of the derivative. The tolerance is then referred to as the (absolute) gradient tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\| \\vec f'(\\vec x^{(i)}) \\| \\lt \\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimisations the scaling problem is exacerbated by the fact that even if we properly scale $f$ (say it always takes a value between 0 and 1), the scaling of $f'$ also depends on the scaling of the unknowns $\\vec x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *some* minimisation problems, the minimal value is well known, it is only the location of the minimizer $\\vec x^*$ that is unknown. In this case, we could base our stopping criterion on $f$ as well, but we have to be careful in case there are other local minima with higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same objections to stalling criteria, which can be either in $\\vec x$, $f(\\vec x)$, or $f'(\\vec x)$, apply to minimisation problems. A termination based on a stalling criterion, should be followed by a check to see that the gradient is small. Regardless of stopping criterion, we could additionally check whether the achieved stationary point is actually a local minimum, by checking whether the Hessian $f''(\\vec x)$ is SPD - however this check is hard to perform for large scale problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if a local minimum is obtained in a point that is not differentiable, think for instance of $f(x)=|x|$ in 1D, the gradient may not actually converge to 0. In such cases, the method might not converge at all with $\\vec x^{(i)}$ jumping around the minimum, or, what often happens, is that the line search or trust region method breaks down, since the decrease of $f$ predicted by the gradient, cannot actually be achieved (think of the Armijo rule from the previous lecture). In practice many problems are actually non-differentiable; They are only smooth enough by approximation. For instance in the approximation of a numerical model, and many other applications with gridded data, there will usually be some grid-scale noise. If the problem is smooth enough on the larger scale, we will be able to achieve some reduction of the gradient, but if we set our tolerances too tight the method will break down as we get closer to the solution. This problem is illustrated in the following figure."

    "In the figure above, we see a quadratic function $f$ with some added noise. The noise here is purely random, but this is very similar to noise one might see in the output of a numerical model, or in measurements. In the top-left figure the noise is hardly visible, and only in the zoom-in of the same graph (bottom-left figure) some noise can be seen. When we look at the derivative of $f$ treated as a piecewise linear function (top-right, and zoom-in bottom-right), we see a lot more noise. This is typical of numerical derivatives on gridded data; Even if the noise in $f$ itself is small, the noise in $f'$ is significant because the variations happen over small distances at the scale of the grid resolution. An optimisation algorithm that finds local minima by searching for the roots in $f'$ will strugle to reduce the absolute value of $f'$ to below $0.1$."

    "where $\\mat{B}^{(i)}$ is the Hessian, or an approximation of it, at $\\vec x^{(i)}$, we have used a direct solve to compute $\\vec{p}^{(i)}$ exactly. In many cases, as we will come back to  in more detail in lecture 5, iterative solvers can be more efficient than direct methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture 2, we have already encountered a very effective iterative solver to solve linear systems where the matrix is SPD. We know that after $n$ iterations (where $n$ is the number of rows/columns of the matrix) this method converges to the answer exactly. A natural idea would be to look if we can get away with solving the system less accurately, and stop the iteration as soon as the residual $\\vec r=\\vec A\\vec x-\\vec b$ has been reduced by a certain factor (a relative tolerance!). After all we have seen that we can get away with pretty big approximations in the Hessian itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, we can indeed get away with a very loose tolerance, and thus dramatically decrease the cost of the linear solve in each Newton iteration. Moreover, it turns out that making this approximation can actually increase the robustness of the Newton method! This seems like a little counter-intuitive, but is in-line with our experience with trust region methods and also a method like BFGS. There the modification/approximation of the Hessian makes the method more robust when the exact Hessian is not well-behaved (i.e. not SPD). A similar process takes place if we solve the update-step not exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, when we were looking at the Conjugate Gradient algorithm, it became clear that the very first iteration is exactly the same as steepest descent. Thus intuitively we can see that a rough approximation with just a few iterations of CG stays closer to the steepest descent method, which deals more robustly with an indefinite Hessian. What is remarkable however, that it can be proven that this rough approximation is enough to maintain the convergence properties of the Newton method when we are getting near the local minimum. In other words we only need to do a little better than steepest descent, to maintain the local convergence properties of the Newton method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach, Newton's method where the linear solve is done with only a few iterations of an iterative solver, is refered to as a <a class=\"definition\" href=\"#definitions\" id=\"truncatedNewton\">truncated Newton</a> method. In particular the combination of Newton with truncated CG, often just referred to simply as <a class=\"definition\" href=\"#definitions\" id=\"NewtonCG\">Newton-CG</a>, is a very popular method. Where, as we have seen yesterday, pure Newton with a line search is not very robust in the present of indefinite Hessians, Newton-CG with a line search is a much more robust method (as we will see in the example below). In `scipy.optimization` it is available as `newton-cg` and the `tnc` methods of [`minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) (the latter also offers simple bound restrictions as L-BFGS-B). For added robustness the Newton-CG approach is also often combined with a trust region approach (e.g. `trust-ncg` of [`minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html))."

    "\n",
    "As we have seen so far, using gradient information can significantly improve convergence of optimisation algorithms. When using quasi-Newton methods for optimisation we can avoid the need for a Hessian, but we still require the gradient of the function we optimise. Calculating the gradient however can be a challenge. Often the evaluation of the function $f$ itself involves running a, potentially complex, computer code.\n",
    "This means that we need to work out what the derivative is of the outcomes of our computer model with respect to the things we want to vary in the optimisation. There are various ways of obtaining this information. For small codes, we can work it out for ourselves by looking at the actual mathematical operations that are performed in sequence within a (computer) function and applying the chain rule to it. You will find out that this approach gets a little tedious soon, and will be infeasible for larger codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are automated ways to derive this information using so called <a class=\"definition\" href=\"#definitions\" id=\"AutomatedDifferentationAD\">Automated Differentation (AD)</a> tools. For compiled languages they may scan and interpret the actual source code and automatically derive new code that computes the derivative. Another approach is to record *at run-time* which operations are being performed, and then, when requested, to use this information to derive the gradient. There are various different approaches implemented in a number of Automated Differenation frameworks each with their own strengths and weaknesses: the level of complexity, how much manual intervention is still required, and run-time efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function evaluation is based upon the solution of a PDE, with the input parameters used as initial or boundary conditions, or source terms, we may also consider the adjoint method. Here we reformulate the optimisation problem as a PDE-constrained optimisation problem and derive associated adjoint equations, a new PDE that we need to solve to obtain the desired gradient information. We will come back to this topic in lecture 7."

    "Regardless of the method that is used to construct the derivative, it will become clear that this can be an error-prone business. It is therefore of the greatest importance to *test* whether our derivative function is correct. The best way to do this, is to use the so called <a class=\"definition\" href=\"#definitions\" id=\"Taylortest\">Taylor test</a>. The idea is very simple: let's treat our computer program as a mathematical function $f(\\vec x)$ that takes a number of input values gathered together in a vector $\\vec x$ and returns a value $f(\\vec x)$. Of course our program could be producing a lot of numbers, but for simplicity let's say there is just one output, the number $f(\\vec x)$. Then if $f'(\\vec x)$ is the derivative of this function - this implies that $f$ is actually differentiable as a mathematical function - then by Taylor's theorem we may write:\n",

    "where $\\vec h$ is a (small) perturbation of our input values $\\vec x$. Note that if the computer program has $n$ input values, then both $\\vec x$ and $\\vec h$ are vectors in $\\R^n$, and we need to consider perturbations in all $n$ directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of phrasing the Taylor approximation, is to say that $f$ and its linear approximation around $f$ converge quadratically as $\\|h\\|\\to 0$. The difference between the two is called the Taylor residual\n",

    "## Polygons, Perimeter and Area\n",
    "To bring some of the ideas of today's lecture in to practice we will look at a shape optimisation problem based on the geometric properties of a shape such as the perimeter and area. We will describe the shapes as polygons. Polygons are given by a list of points, the vertices, with edges that are straight lines between the subsequent vertices. There are other, more sophisticated ways to describe shapes, such as [Bézier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve), but we will not use those here. We use the convention that the first and the last point in the list are the same, to describe a closed polygon. Another convention we use is that the vertices in this list are given in counter clockwise order.\n",

    "To start we introduce a little helper function that creates a regular polygon, a polygon of which all edge lengths and all angles are the same."

    "As always, we should test all components of our software. In the today's tutorial you will be asked to verify the results of these function applied to some regular polygons using known analytical expressions for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to use these function in an gradient-based optimisation, we also need derivatives of these functions, and as argued in previous section test these using the Taylor test. We start by looking at the derivative of our `length` function. The function `length`$(\\vec x)$ takes a vector $\\vec x\\in\\R^{(n+1)\\times 2}$, where $n$ is the number of edges, $n+1$ the number of vertices, and we need a $\\times 2$ because we are in 2D and each vertex is given by a 2-vector. Therefore the derivative of `length` in $\\vec x$ should itself be a vector in $\\R^{(n+1)\\times 2}$, which indicates how much the function `length`$(\\vec x)$ would change by a small perturbation in each direction. Strictly speaking we should actually be talking about $\\vec x$ and the derivative as vectors in $\\R^{2(n+1)}$ (for example with $n=4$, they would be vectors in $\\R^{10}$), but for convenience in our code we store them as rank 2 arrays with a shape of $(n+1,2)$, so $n+1$ rows and 2 columns.\n",

In today's tutorial you will be asked to derive and test the gradient of the `area` function as well. We will then perform our first shape optimisation based upon a shape factor functional that combines both functions. This is a first step in a shape optimisation problem that we will further develop next week, where we will optimise the shape of an airfoil."

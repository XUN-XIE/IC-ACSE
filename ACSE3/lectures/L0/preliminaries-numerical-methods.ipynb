    "This module sits at the interface of: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. applied science/engineering - we are ultimately motivated by the need to understand numerical methods designed to solve real world problems; \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. mathematics - we need to pose our real world problems mathematically, and also use mathematics to derive algorithms/methods and establish properties which govern their strengths/weaknesses and optimal usage;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. computing - we need to be able to implement our developed algorithms in code (or call libraries which already contain their implementation), and apply them in anger to our problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You all come to this module (and course) with a **range of backgrounds**: for many of you almost all of this module with be new, but some of you will have done an introductory course with a title such as \"numerical methods\", \"numerical analysis\", \"computational physics\", \"scientific computing\", ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To cater for this range of backgrounds, in this module we will start every topic assuming very little prior knowledge - generally just some familiarity with linear algebra and differential equations. However, to keep things interesting for those of you that do know some of this material we will try to progress reasonably rapidly to methods and results that are of real value to complex real world problems, and also move on to some more advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**We won't have time to cover all of the material provided in each notebook within the lecture time**. The rest should be considered as providing you with structured guidance for your **private study** (remember each module has a significant amount of expected \"independent study time\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not manage to reach the end of a lecture, even in this independent study time, or don't follow some of the mathematical content, **don't worry**. The key learning objectives for you are to understand the general ideas and concepts, how to formulate and solve problems, the \"best practice\" usage guidance associated with different types of method, and how to implement some of the methods we encounter either in our own code, or via calls to appropriate Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding the mathematical content**. Some mathematical background is given in places, this is intended to \"stretch you\" (i.e. to develop your mathematical knowledge and confidence) and to aid in your general understanding. However, for some of you some of this material may seem quite advanced. If this is the case for you then please **do not be disheartened**, just ignore this material. It's far more important that you **understand the \"big picture\" and are able to \"apply techniques\"**, it's far less important you understand the mathematical underpinning or are able to \"prove results\". \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm very happy to discuss concerns, as well as to provide guidance on **potential research projects** which make use of some of these methods in real applications, or indeed develop some of the methods themselves."

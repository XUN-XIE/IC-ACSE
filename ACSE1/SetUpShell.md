# Linux (Ubuntu) laptops

To get a shell, run a terminal by pressing the Windows key then typing 'Terminal'.

# OS X

Open a Finder window, select 'Applications' in the left-hand pane, navigate to the 'Utilities' folder and open the 'Terminal' application.

# Windows 10

In the search bar type 'Windows Features' and select 'Turn Windows Features On Or Off'. 

Scroll down to the bottom of the list and tick the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” option, then click the “OK” button.

Click “Restart now” when you’re prompted to restart your computer.

After restarting, type 'apps: ubuntu' in the search bar, and select the 'Ubuntu' result. Then 'Install' Ubuntu.

When prompted, 'launch' Ubuntu. This will take a few minutes and then prompt you for a username and password. We recommend you use your Imperial username here.

If you need to access Windows files from the Linux subsystem, you can find them via:

```cd /mnt/c/Users/<username>/```

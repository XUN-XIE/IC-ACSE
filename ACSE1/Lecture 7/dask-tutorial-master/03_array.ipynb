    "\n",
    "Dask.array does not implement the entire numpy interface.  Users expecting this\n",
    "will be disappointed.  Notably dask.array has the following failings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dask does not implement all of ``np.linalg``.  This has been done by a\n",
    "    number of excellent BLAS/LAPACK implementations and is the focus of\n",
    "    numerous ongoing academic research projects.\n",
    "2.  Dask.array does not support any operation where the resulting shape\n",
    "    depends on the values of the array.  In order to form the Dask graph we\n",
    "    must be able to infer the shape of the array before actually executing the\n",
    "    operation.  This precludes operations like indexing one Dask array with\n",
    "    another or operations like ``np.where``.\n",
    "3.  Dask.array does not attempt operations like ``sort`` which are notoriously\n",
    "    difficult to do in parallel and are of somewhat diminished value on very\n",
    "    large data (you rarely actually need a full sort).\n",
    "    Often we include parallel-friendly alternatives like ``topk``.\n",
    "4.  Dask development is driven by immediate need, and so many lesser used\n",
    "    functions, like ``np.full_like`` have not been implemented purely out of\n",
    "    laziness.  These would make excellent community contributions."

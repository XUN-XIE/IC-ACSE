    "As Python programmers, you probably already perform certain *tricks* to enable computation of larger-than-memory datasets, parallel execution or delayed/background execution. Perhaps with this phrasing, it is not clear what we mean, but a few examples should make things clearer. The point of Dask is to make simple things easy and complex things possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the [detailed introduction](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/), we can summarize the basics of Dask as follows:\n",
    "- process data that doesn't fit into memory by breaking it into blocks and specifying task chains\n",
    "- parallelize execution of tasks across cores and even nodes of a cluster\n",
    "- move computation to the data rather than the other way around, to minimize communication overheads\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this allows you to get the most out of your computation resources, but program in a way that is very familiar: for-loops to build basic tasks, Python iterators, and the Numpy (array) and Pandas (dataframe) functions for multi-dimensional or tabular data, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook will take you through the first of these programming paradigms. This is more detail than some users will want, who can skip ahead to the iterator, array and dataframe sections; but there will be some data processing tasks that don't easily fit into those abstractions and need to fall back to the methods here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We include a few examples at the end of the notebooks showing that the ideas behind how Dask is built are not actually that novel, and experienced programmers will have met parts of the design in other situations before. Those examples are left for the interested."

Dask will intelligently execute your calculation with care for minimizing the amount of data held in memory, while parallelizing over the tasks that make up a graph.

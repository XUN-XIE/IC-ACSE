Dask provides multi-core execution on larger-than-memory datasets.

We can think of dask at a high and a low level

*  **High level collections:**  Dask provides high-level Array, Bag, and DataFrame
   collections that mimic NumPy, lists, and Pandas but can operate in parallel on
   datasets that don't fit into main memory.  Dask's high-level collections are
   alternatives to NumPy and Pandas for large datasets.
*  **Low Level schedulers:** Dask provides dynamic task schedulers that
   execute task graphs in parallel.  These execution engines power the
   high-level collections mentioned above but can also power custom,
   user-defined workloads.  These schedulers are low-latency (around 1ms) and
   work hard to run computations in a small memory footprint.  Dask's
   schedulers are an alternative to direct use of `threading` or
   `multiprocessing` libraries in complex cases or other task scheduling
   systems like `Luigi` or `IPython parallel`.

Different users operate at different levels but it is useful to understand
both.  This tutorial will interleave between high-level use of `dask.array` and
`dask.dataframe` (even sections) and low-level use of dask graphs and
schedulers (odd sections.)

## Prepare

You should clone this repository

    git clone http://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial

and then install necessary packages.

#### a) Create a conda environment (preferred)

In the main repo directory

    conda env create -f binder/environment.yml 
    conda activate dask-tutorial
    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

#### b) Install into an existing environment

You will need the following core libraries

    conda install numpy pandas h5py pillow matplotlib scipy toolz pytables snakeviz scikit-image dask distributed -c conda-forge

You may find the following libraries helpful for some exercises

    conda install python-graphviz -c conda-forge
    
Note that this options will alter your existing environment, potentially changing the versions of packages you already 
have installed. 
    
#### c) Use Dockerfile

You can build a docker image out of the provided Dockerfile.

    $ docker build . # This will build using the same env as in a)

Run a container, replacing the ID with the output of the previous command

    $ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 <container_id_or_tag>

The above command will give an URL (`Like http://(container_id or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=<sometoken>`) which 
can be used to access the notebook from browser. You may need to replace the given hostname with "localhost" or
"127.0.0.1".

### Prepare artificial data.

This is also done in the first notebook, but will only make data not
already created. You may skip this and only make artificial data as required in the specific sections of the
tutorial.

From the repo directory (within the running notebook server if using method c) ) 

    python prep.py


### Launch notebook

From the repo directory

    jupyter notebook 

This was already done for method c) and does not need repeating.

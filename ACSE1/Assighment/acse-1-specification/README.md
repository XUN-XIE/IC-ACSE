# ACSE-1 : Modern Programming Practices
## Assessment 2: Cellular Automata

In this programming exercise, you will create a python module file providing implementations of several simple cellular automata.

See [assessment2.pdf](./assessment2.pdf) for the full formal exercise definition.

__Reminder: This is an individual assessment.__

Although students are encouraged to discuss the problem background and coding techniques with their peers, you should not allow other students to examine your actual code, nor attempt to view the code of others. In cases of doubt, students may be examined on their submission via oral assessment

#### Submission deadline

The final version of your module should be submitted via your GitHub Classrooms repository by 12 noon on Friday 18th October 2019.
